These breakpoints provide a general guideline for designing responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes. However, it's important to remember that the boundaries between these categories can be somewhat fluid, and the exact breakpoints you choose may vary depending on your specific design requirements and the devices you're targeting. Additionally, with the increasing diversity of device sizes and resolutions, using fluid and flexible layout techniques is often preferable to relying solely on fixed breakpoints.
