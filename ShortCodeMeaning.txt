We can understand the actual meaning of code & logic behind it.
1) Code Snippet 1:
dynamically set the class name and style of an icon based on the item.type value.

<i className={`fa fa-${item.type === 'column' ? 'bar' : item.type === 'spline' || item.type === 'stepLine' ? 'line' : item.type}-chart`} style={{ color: item.color }} />

-->Font Awesome Icons -
   Line Chart - fa fa-line-chart
   Bar Chart - fa fa-bar-chart
   Area Chart -  fa fa-area-chart
 we have only this three icons but type have more option so Line chart can be used for spline & stepline chart as well as bar chart is used for column chart
 className={fa fa-${item.type === 'column' ? 'bar' : item.type === 'spline' || item.type === 'stepLine' ? 'line' : item.type}-chart}

    i) This dynamically sets the class name of the <i> tag.
    ii) If item.type is 'column', it sets the class to 'fa fa-bar-chart'.
    If item.type is 'spline' or 'stepLine', it sets the class to 'fa fa-line-chart'.
    Otherwise, it sets the class to 'fa fa-${item.type}-chart', where ${item.type} is the value of item.type.
    iii) style={{ color: item.color }}:
    This dynamically sets the color of the icon using the item.color value.
In summary, this line renders an icon with a class name and color based on the item.type and item.color values passed to the component.


2) Code Snippet 2:
If we want to toggle on div and another div close in nutshell if one time we want to toggle only one div then we used below code,
  const [visibleBlock, setVisibleBlock] = useState(null);
  const toggleVisibility = (blockNumber) => {
        setVisibleBlock(prevVisibleBlock => prevVisibleBlock === blockNumber ? null : blockNumber);
    };
--> i] blockNumber- blockNumber is a parameter passed to the toggleVisibility function, representing the identifier or number of the block that the user clicked on 
       to toggle its visibility.
   ii] prevVisibleBlock- prevVisibleBlock is a variable representing the current visible block before the toggle action. 
  iii] prevVisibleBlock === blockNumber ? null : blockNumber:
       This ternary expression checks if the current visible block (prevVisibleBlock) is the same as the blockNumber passed to the function.
       If they are the same (prevVisibleBlock === blockNumber), it sets prevVisibleBlock to null, effectively hiding the block.
       If they are different, it sets prevVisibleBlock to the blockNumber, making that block visible.
In summary, the toggleVisibility function toggles the visibility of a block. If the block with the given blockNumber is currently visible, it hides it by setting the visible block to null. If it's hidden or another block is visible, it shows the block with the given blockNumber.

3)Code Snippet 3:
  {tableFormat.map((item, index) => (
            <tr key={index}>
              {/* If it's the first cell, apply the props */}
              {index === 0 ? (
                <td style={item.props}>{item.label}</td>
              ) : (
                // For other cells, render empty cells
                <td></td>
              )}


4) code snippet 4:
    const calculateTableLayout = () => {
      const totalKPIs = kpis.length;
      const sqrt = Math.sqrt(totalKPIs);
      const rows = Math.ceil(sqrt);
      const columns = Math.ceil(totalKPIs / rows);
    return { rows, columns };
  };
  const { rows, columns } = calculateTableLayout();

  const chunkedKpis = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < kpis.length; i += columns) {
    chunkedKpis.push(kpis.slice(i, i + columns));
  }

5) code snippet 5:
    const handleResizeStop = (layout) => {
        const updatedItems = items.map(item => {
            const layoutItem = layout.find(l => l.i === item.id);
            return layoutItem ? { ...item, ...layoutItem } : item;
        });

        setPageData(data.map(page => ({
            ...page,
            items: updatedItems
        })));
    };
 i] Inside the function, it defines a variable updatedItems. It's using the items.map method to iterate over each item in the items array
ii] For each item, it's attempting to find the corresponding layout item in the layout array using the find method.
iii] This line attempts to find a layout item whose i property matches the id property of the current item.
iv] If a layout item is found (layoutItem is truthy), it returns a new object merging the properties of the original item and the layout item ({ ...item, ...layoutItem })(changed item).
If no layout item is found (layoutItem is falsy), it returns the original item unchanged (item)
v] Finally, it updates the page data by mapping over the data array. For each page, it spreads the properties of the page and updates the items property with the updatedItems.
This commented-out code appears to be a previous version of the handleResizeStop function. It's likely responsible for updating the layout of items after resizing stops. However, it seems to be replaced or updated in your current implementation.

5) code snippet 6:
    const handleSelectItem = (id) => {
        const updatedData = data.map(page => ({
            ...page,
            items: page.items.map(item => ({
                ...item,
                select: item.id === id
            }))
        }));
        setPageData(updatedData);
        setSidebarVisibility(true)
    };

6) code snippet 7:
 const sortedNavigation = [...navigation].sort((a, b) => a.position - b.position);

1] const sortedNavigation: This declares a new constant variable named sortedNavigation to store the sorted array.
2] ([...navigation]): This part creates a shallow copy of the navigation array using the spread operator [...]. 
This ensures that the original array navigation remains unchanged during the sorting process.
3] .sort((a, b) => a.position - b.position): This method sorts the copied array based on a comparison function. Here, the comparison function (a, b) => a.position - b.position is used.
4] (a, b) are two elements being compared during the sorting process.
5] a.position - b.position is a comparison operation based on the position property of the elements a and b.
6] If a.position is less than b.position, the comparison function returns a negative value, indicating that a should come before b in the sorted array.
7] If a.position is greater than b.position, the comparison function returns a positive value, indicating that b should come before a in the sorted array.
8]If a.position is equal to b.position, the comparison function returns 0, indicating that the relative order of a and b remains unchanged.
Summary:
After sorting, sortedNavigation will contain the elements of navigation sorted by their position property in ascending order.
This is useful for maintaining a consistent order of elements based on their positions.
