We can understand the actual meaning of code & logic behind it.
1) dynamically set the class name and style of an icon based on the item.type value.

<i className={`fa fa-${item.type === 'column' ? 'bar' : item.type === 'spline' || item.type === 'stepLine' ? 'line' : item.type}-chart`} style={{ color: item.color }} />

-->Font Awesome Icons -
   Line Chart - fa fa-line-chart
   Bar Chart - fa fa-bar-chart
   Area Chart -  fa fa-area-chart
 we have only this three icons but type have more option so Line chart can be used for spline & stepline chart as well as bar chart is used for column chart
 className={fa fa-${item.type === 'column' ? 'bar' : item.type === 'spline' || item.type === 'stepLine' ? 'line' : item.type}-chart}

    i) This dynamically sets the class name of the <i> tag.
    ii) If item.type is 'column', it sets the class to 'fa fa-bar-chart'.
    If item.type is 'spline' or 'stepLine', it sets the class to 'fa fa-line-chart'.
    Otherwise, it sets the class to 'fa fa-${item.type}-chart', where ${item.type} is the value of item.type.
    iii) style={{ color: item.color }}:
    This dynamically sets the color of the icon using the item.color value.
In summary, this line renders an icon with a class name and color based on the item.type and item.color values passed to the component.


2) If we want to toggle on div and another div close in nutshell if one time we want to toggle only one div then we used below code,
  const [visibleBlock, setVisibleBlock] = useState(null);
  const toggleVisibility = (blockNumber) => {
        setVisibleBlock(prevVisibleBlock => prevVisibleBlock === blockNumber ? null : blockNumber);
    };
--> i] blockNumber- blockNumber is a parameter passed to the toggleVisibility function, representing the identifier or number of the block that the user clicked on 
       to toggle its visibility.
   ii] prevVisibleBlock- prevVisibleBlock is a variable representing the current visible block before the toggle action. 
  iii] prevVisibleBlock === blockNumber ? null : blockNumber:
       This ternary expression checks if the current visible block (prevVisibleBlock) is the same as the blockNumber passed to the function.
       If they are the same (prevVisibleBlock === blockNumber), it sets prevVisibleBlock to null, effectively hiding the block.
       If they are different, it sets prevVisibleBlock to the blockNumber, making that block visible.
In summary, the toggleVisibility function toggles the visibility of a block. If the block with the given blockNumber is currently visible, it hides it by setting the visible block to null. If it's hidden or another block is visible, it shows the block with the given blockNumber.
